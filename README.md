**Deprecated 2018**: This project has been dormant a long time, but if you're still looking for something like this you should probably check out [WP-CLI](https://wp-cli.org/) if you haven't already. It's better in pretty much every conceivable way.

I've left everything else intact for posterity.


WordPress Quick Install
=======================

I keep this script on my server so that I can start an up-to-date WordPress project almost anywhere, along with the plugins I enjoy and am used to working with.  It's hosted here on GitHub, so I can execute this from the terminal by typing:

`curl https://raw.github.com/snaptortoise/wordpress-quick-install/master/wordpress | sh`

It will download the latest version of WordPress, along with the latest version of all the plugins listed at the end of this README doc, and install them to the current directory.  I find it saves time.

Alternatively, you can make the `wordpress`  file executable and keep it somewhere in your `$PATH` if you're rather keep it local.
